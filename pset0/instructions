Here are the steps for completing this warmup problem:

1) Copy the file from the following location to your personal computer:

/home/users/hampton2/lab1_313/animal.jpg

To do this, you'll probably use a command like this (from a terminal on YOUR computer, not on ix-dev):

scp username@ix-dev.cs.uoregon.edu:/home/users/hampton2/lab1_313/animal.jpg .

Don't forget the dot at the end! That's saying you want to copy the file to the current directory you run the command from.

Open the picture and see what kind of animal it is!

2) Now, log back onto ix-dev and go to the pset0 directory you created before. Create a file called 'problem1' using the touch command:

touch problem1

3) Use your favorite command-line editor to type the name of the animal in the file problem1. If you haven't used a command-line editor before, try using nano:

nano problem1

4) Check that you got the answer right, and it's formatted the same as my solution:

diff problem1 /home/users/hampton2/lab1_313/problem1_solution

If there's no output from the diff command, you've got it right! Otherwise, diff tells you what the difference is. Use the command-line editor to fix your problem1 file until it exactly matches mine.

That's it! You're done with this part of the warmup.
